Title: Lightweight Pseudo 3D Rendering with Sprite Stacks and Normal Mapping

Contents are open source. This project relies on gtk-d, bindbc-loader, and bindbc-opengl and is primarily written in DLang and GLSL. Boilerplate shader program (graphicsapp.d) and SDL/OpenGL Abstractions (opengl_abstraction.d, sdl_abstraction.d) are used with permission from advisor Mike Shah (taken from CPSC 409 PSET 1 Part 3, Yale University). The file graphicsapp.d has been modified to fit the needs of this project while the opengl_abstraction.d and sdl_abstraction.d are unmodified. Any reasonably large amounts of code that come from other sources are credited in the comments.
